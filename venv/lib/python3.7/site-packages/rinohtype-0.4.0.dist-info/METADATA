rinohtype is a batch-mode document processor. It renders structured documents
to PDF based on a document template and a style sheet. An important design goal
of rinohtype is make document layout and style customization user-friendly. See
the documentation_ to learn how to customize the style of your document.

rinohtype is still in beta, so you might run into some issues when using it.
I'd highly appreciate it if you could `create a ticket`_ for any bugs you may
encounter. That said, it's already quite capable. For example, it should be
able to replace Sphinx_'s LaTeX builder in most cases. Here is an overview of
the main features:

* a powerful page layout system supporting columns, running headers/footers,
  floatable elements and footnotes
* support for figures and (large) tables
* automatic generation of table of contents and index
* automatic numbering and cross-referencing of section headings, figures and
  tables
* configure one of the included document templates or create your own
* an intuitive style sheet system inspired by CSS
* modular design allowing for multiple frontends (such as reStructuredText,
  Markdown, DocBook, ...)
* handles OpenType, TrueType and Type1 fonts with support for advanced
  typographic features such as kerning, ligatures, small capitals and old style
  figures
* embeds PDF, PNG and JPEG images, preserving transparency and color profiles
* easy to install and deploy; pure-Python with few dependencies
* built on Unicode; ready for non-latin languages

rinohtype's primary input format is reStructuredText_. The ``rinoh`` command
line tool renders reStructuredText documents and the included Sphinx_ builder
makes it possible to output large documents with your own style applied. Have
a look at the `rinohtype documentation`_ for an example of the output.

Requirements
------------

rinohtype supports Python 3.5 and up. For parsing reStructuredText and
CommonMark documents, rinohtype depends on docutils_ and recommonmark_
respectively. pip_ takes care of these requirements when you install rinohtype.

Syntax highlighting of code blocks is eneabled if Pygments_ is installed, which
will be installed automatically with Sphinx_. If you want to include images
other than PDF, PNG or JPEG, you also need to install Pillow_.

.. _docutils: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/index.html
.. _recommonmark: https://recommonmark.readthedocs.io
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Pygments: https://pygments.org
.. _Pillow: http://python-pillow.github.io


Getting Started
---------------

Installation is trivial::

    pip install rinohtype


reStructuredText Renderer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to get started with rinohtype is to render a reStructuredText
document (such as ``CHANGES.rst`` from this repository) using the ``rinoh``
command line tool::

   rinoh CHANGES.rst

When ``rinoh`` finishes, you will find ``CHANGES.pdf`` alongside the input
file.

By default ``rinoh`` renders the input document using the article template. Run
``rinoh --help`` to see how you can tell ``rinoh`` which document template and
style sheet to use.


Sphinx Builder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

rinohtype can be used as a drop-in replacement for the LaTeX builder (the
``latex_documents`` configuration variable has to be set). Simply select the
`rinoh` builder when building the Sphinx project::

    sphinx-build -b rinoh . _build/rinoh

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

* automatically generated lists of figures and tables
* paragraphs now provide default tab stops (proportional to font size) for
  indentation
* stylesheet (.rts) and template configuration (.rtt) files now support
  specifying inline and background images (#107 and #108); to be documented
* it is now possible to specify selector priority (+-) in style sheets
* Sphinx frontend: the rinoh builder can be discovered by entry point
  (no more need to add 'rinoh.frontend.sphinx' to the list of extensions)

  found (issue #104)
* rinoh: introduce the ``--install-resources`` option to control the automatic
  installation of resources from PyPI

* Polish locale (contributed by Mariusz Jamro)

Changed:

* Python 3.3 & 3.4 are no longer supported since they have reached end-of-life
* remove the dependency on purepng by embedding its png.py
* limit the width of images to the available width by default
* XML frontend: special case mixed content nodes
* fixes in the design of stylesheet/template code

Fixed:

* various footnote rendering issues
* border width is also taken into account for flowables that are continued on a
  new page (#127)

* incompatibility with Sphinx 1.6.1+ (latex_paper_size)
* docutils: crash when a footnote is defined in an admonition (issue #95)
* docutils: crash on encountering a raw text role (issue #99)
* docutils: 'decoration' node (header/footer) is not yet supported (issue #112)
* crash when a table cell contains (only) an image
* colours of PNG images with gamma (gAMA chunk) set are incorrect (#102)
* Sphinx: image paths with wildcard extension are not supported (#119)
* GroupedFlowables: space_below should only be considered at the end

  default in Python 3.7 (issue #133)
* fix compatibility with Python 3.6.7 and 3.7.1 (tokenizer changes)
* fix crash caused by Python 3.8's changes to int.__str__


Release 0.3.1 (2016-12-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

* rinoh is now also available as a stand-alone application for both Windows
  (installer) and macOS (app); they include an embedded CPython installation
* index terms can be StyledText now (in addition to str)
* the 'document author' metadata entry can now be displayed using a Field
* Sphinx frontend: support the 'desc_signature_line' node (new in Sphinx 1.5)
* rinoh --docs: open the online documentation in the default browser

Changed:

* more closely mimic the Sphinx LaTeX builder's title page (issue #60)
* there is no default for PageTemplate.chapter_title_flowables anymore since
  they are specific to the document template

Fixed:

* handle StyledText metadata (such as document title)
* Sphinx frontend: support the 'autosummary_toc' node
* DummyFlowable now sticks to the flowable following it (keep_with_next), so
  that (1) it does not break this behavior of Heading preceding it, and
  (2) IndexTargets do not get separated from the following flowable
* bug in LabeledFlowable that broke keep_with_next behavior
* the descender size of the last flowable in a GroupedFlowables with
  keep_with_next=True was getting lost
* GroupedFlowables should not mark the page non-empty; this caused empty pages
  before the first chapter if it is preceded by grouped DummyFlowables


Release 0.3.0 (2016-11-23)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New Features:

* support localization of standard document strings (en, fr, it, nl) (#53)
* localized strings can be overridden in the document template configuration
* make use of a fallback typeface when a glyph is not available (#55)
  (the 'fallback' style in the Sphinx stylesheet sets the fallback typeface)
* template configuration (INI) files: specify which document parts to include,
  configure document part and page templates, customize localized strings, ...
* support specifying more complex selectors directly in a style sheet file
* (figure and table) captions support hierarchical numbering (see CaptionStyle)
* make the frontends independent of the current working directory
* reStructuredText: support the table :widths: option (upcoming docutils 0.13)
* Sphinx frontend: provide styles for Sphinx's inline markup roles
* rinoh (command line renderer):

  - support template configuration files
  - support file formats for which a frontend is installed (see --list-formats)

  - option to list the installed fonts (on the command line or in a PDF file)

* show the current page number as part of the rendering progress indicator
* Book template: support for setting a cover page
* frontends: raise a more descriptive exception when a document tree node is
  not mapped
* validate the default value passed to an Attribute
* preliminary support for writing a style sheet to an INI file, listing default
  values for non-specified attributes (#23)

Changed:

* rinoh: the output PDF is now placed in the current directory, not in the same
  directory as the input file
* Sphinx builder configuration: replace the ``rinoh_document_template`` and
  ``rinoh_template_configuration`` options with ``rinoh_template``
* if no base is given for a style, style attribute lookup proceeds to look in
  the style of the same name in the base style sheet (#66)
* DEFAULT_STYLE can be used as a base style to prevent style attribute lookup
  in the style of the same name in the base style sheet
* rename FieldList to DefinitionList and use it to replace uses (docutils and
  Sphinx frontends) of the old DefinitionList (#54)
* the new DefinitionList (FieldList) can be styled like the old DefinitionList
  by setting max_label_width to None, 0 or a 0-valued Dimension
* figures are now non-floating by default (float placement needs more work)
* hide the index chapter when there are no index entries (#51)
* style sheets: use the default matcher if none is specified
* Sphinx style sheet: copy the admonition style from the Sphinx LaTeX builder
* Sphinx style sheet: keep the admonition title together with the body
* Sphinx style sheet: color linked references as in the LaTeX output (#62)
* Sphinx style sheet: disable hyphenation/ligatures for literal strong text
* no more DocumentSection; a document now consists of parts (containing pages)
* template configuration:

  - refer to document part templates by name so that they can be replaced
  - the list of document parts can be changed in the template configuration
  - document parts take the 'end_at_page' option (left, right, or any)
  - find (left/right) page templates via the document part name they belong to
  - fall back to <doc_part>_page when the right or left template is not found
  - each template configuration requires a name

* DocumentTree: make the ``source_file`` argument optional
* don't abort when the document section hierarchy is missing levels (#67)
* use the PDF backend by default (no need to specify it)
* store the unit with Dimension instances (better printing)
* rename the `float` module to `image`

Fixed:

* improve compatibility with Windows: Windows path names and file encoding
* crash if a StyledText is passed to HeadingStyle.number_separator
* GroupedLabeledFlowables label width could be unnecessarily wide
* fix and improve automatic table column sizing
* Figures can now be referenced using the 'reference' format ("Figure 1.2")
